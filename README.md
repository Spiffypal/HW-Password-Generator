PASSWORD GENERATOR README

#1 Assignment:

This assignment is to generate a password based on criteria for the user when the button "Generate Password" is clicked.

The button is to ask the following:
1.  How long will the password be?
2.  Will the password use lowercase letters?
3.  Will the password use uppcase letters?\
4.  Will the password use numbers?
5.  Will the password use Symbols?

The first prompt asking the length - the length must be higher than 7 characters. Meaning 8 is the minimum.

The rest is optional.
